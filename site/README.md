# site

The documentation at <https://floatdrop.github.io/grpcproc/>: a set of
pages, prerendered to static HTML with no JavaScript but a small inlined
script for the theme, the navigation and the outline. Its code blocks are the
files of [`examples/`](../examples), imported as text at build time and
highlighted with Shiki, and the output they show is what the examples' tests
pin, so a page cannot drift from the code.

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev       # renders a page on request, reloads on change
npm run check     # type-check
BASE_PATH=/grpcproc npm run build   # build/, as Pages serves it
npm run preview   # serves build/ under its base path
```

## Layout

- `src/nav.ts` is the map: the groups of pages and their order. A page in
  the map with no file, or a file with no place in the map, fails the
  render.
- `src/content/` holds one file per page, exporting a `Doc` (`types.ts`):
  its path, title, one-line description, and sections, each a heading and
  JSX. `index.ts` registers them. `landing.tsx` also holds the front page's
  hero, and `labels.ts` the words of the chrome.
- `src/code.tsx` highlights code synchronously, so a page writes
  `<Code>` inline; `region()` cuts a fragment out of an example file the way
  embedmd does. `src/components/` has the prose helpers (`C`, `A`, `Ext`,
  `Aside`, `Table`, `Cards`), the figure card, and the drawings, which are
  inline SVG built from a few primitives.
- `src/components/diagrams-overview.tsx` holds the overview's drawings,
  which move: each writes its own CSS keyframes, so the page runs no script
  for them, and they stand still under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- `src/Page.tsx` is the chrome: topbar, navigation, the page, its outline,
  previous and next. `src/entry-server.tsx` renders every page and the 404.

After changing an example's code, run its tests with `-update` to refresh
the pinned output: `cd examples && go test ./quickstart ./actors
./supervisor ./blockingio ./pubsub -update` and `go test ./guide -update`.

.github/workflows/pages.yml builds the site on every change to it, to the
examples, or to cron and leader, and deploys it from `main`.
