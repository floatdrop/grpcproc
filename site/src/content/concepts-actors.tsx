	lead: (
		<p>
			grpcproc takes its shape from Erlang, where the unit of a program is a process: state of its
			own, a queue of messages in front of it, and an address anyone can send to. This page says
			what that buys, and what it costs, for a reader who has goroutines and channels.

			title: 'A process is a goroutine with a mailbox',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						A process is a Go function, run on a goroutine of its own, that takes messages from a
						mailbox one at a time. Anything can append to the mailbox, from any goroutine or any
						node; only the process reads from it. Its state lives in local variables nothing else
						touches, so it needs no lock.
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/quickstart/main.go">{region(quickstart, /^func inventory/, /^}/)}</Code>
					<p>
						That is the whole discipline: state lives inside one goroutine, and the only way to
						change it is to send a message. A caller that wants an answer sends a call and waits;
						one that does not sends and moves on. Nothing interrupts a process between two messages,
						so every handler sees a consistent state and leaves one.
					</p>
					<p>
						A mailbox is typed: this one holds <C>*shoppb.Reserve</C> and nothing else, and the
						compiler checks every send to it. The type is a protobuf message, so it has a wire
						encoding already: a process gets the same value from its neighbour in the binary and
						from a process on another machine.
					</p>
				</>
			)
		},
		{
			id: 'messages',
			title: 'Messages instead of shared memory',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						Go already says "do not communicate by sharing memory; share memory by
						communicating". A channel is that advice made concrete, and a process is the next step:
						a channel with an owner, an address, and a lifetime you can observe.
					</p>
					<p>
						A channel has no name: to send on it you need the channel value, so sender and receiver
						were wired together by whoever created both. A channel does not cross a program
						boundary, and it cannot tell you that the goroutine reading it has died; a send to it
						blocks for ever, or never happens, and nothing reports which.
					</p>
					<p>
						A process fixes each of those. Its address, a PID or a registered name, can be passed
						around, stored and sent inside a message, and works from any node in the cluster. And a
						process can be monitored: when it exits, or when its node is lost, whoever asked is
						told, with a reason.
					</p>
					<p>
						What a process does not fix is shared state, on purpose. Two processes never share a
						variable; they share nothing but the messages between them. A value that many parts of a
						program read and write becomes a process that owns it and answers questions about it.
						That is more typing than a mutex, and it is why the process can move to another machine
						without anything else changing.
					</p>
				</>
			)
		},
		{
			id: 'address',
			title: 'An address, not a pointer',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						A message is sent to an address, never to a process value. The address is a PID, which
						names a node and a process on it, or a name the process registered on its node. Both
						are small comparable values that mean the same thing on every node.
					</p>
					<p>
						So the location of a process is nobody's business. <C>Send</C>, <C>Call</C>,{' '}
						<C>Monitor</C> and <C>Exit</C> take an address, look at the node in it, and either
						deliver within the program or write to the link with that node. The code on both ends is
						the same either way.
					</p>
					<Drawing caption="the same call, within a node and across nodes">
						<ActorsPicture />
					</Drawing>
					<p>
						The difference is not hidden; it is where it belongs, in what can go wrong. A remote
						call fails when the link breaks, and the caller finds out; a monitor on a remote process
						fires when the node cannot be reached, with a reason that says so. The{' '}
						<A to="shop/">tutorial</A> runs one application as one program and as three, from the
						same code: only the configuration changes.
					</p>

		{
			id: 'rpc',
			title: 'A process is not an RPC service',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						A gRPC service method runs once per request, on whatever goroutine the server gives it,
						concurrently with every other request. It has no state between calls but what it keeps
						in a database or behind a mutex. That is the right shape for a stateless handler, and
						grpcproc leaves your services as they are.
					</p>
					<p>
						A process is the other shape. It has state, it has a queue, and it handles one message at
						a time. A stock that must not be reserved twice, a session that must see its requests in
						order, a job that runs in steps and can be asked how far it got: each is naturally one
						process, and a mutex around a struct is the usual way of writing one without saying so.
					</p>
					<p>
						The two meet at the edge. In the tutorial an HTTP handler is not a process: it calls one
						through the node, waits with the request's context, and turns the answer into a status
						code. The handler is stateless, the process behind it is not, and the call between them
						is typed like everything else.
					</p>
				</>
			)
		},
		{
			id: 'failure',
			title: 'Failure is a message',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						A process ends when its function returns, and it has a reason: <C>normal</C> for a nil
						return, the error's text otherwise, <C>panic: …</C> for a panic, or whatever an{' '}
						<C>Exit</C> request asked for. The reason is not lost: any process that monitored it
						receives a <C>Down</C> carrying it, after the last message the exiting process sent.
					</p>
					<p>
						A node that cannot be reached is reported the same way: every monitor on a process there
						gets a <C>Down</C> with reason <C>noconnection</C>, and every call waiting on it fails.
						So a watcher does not distinguish a crash from a lost machine unless it wants to, and
						the code that handles one handles the other.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is what goroutines lack. A goroutine that panics takes the program down, one that
						returns leaves no trace, and one whose machine is gone is not a concept. With exits as
						messages, failure is something a program can be written about, and{' '}
						<A to="concepts/monitors-and-links/">Monitors and links</A> is the vocabulary for it.
					</p>
				</>
			)
		},
		{
			id: 'supervision',
			title: 'Let it crash',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						Erlang's answer to a process that fails is not to handle every error inside it, but to
						let it die and have another one, a supervisor, start it again from a known state. Most
						failures come from a state the code did not anticipate, and the surest way out of such a
						state is to leave it. Code that recovers in place keeps the bad state and adds guesses
						to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						A supervisor is itself a process. It starts its children, monitors them, and when one
						exits it applies a policy: restart that child, restart all of them, or give up and exit
						itself, which is its own supervisor's problem. Supervisors of supervisors form a tree,
						and the tree is the program's plan for failure, written down once rather than scattered
						through every handler.
					</p>
					<p>
						In grpcproc a supervisor is nothing the core knows about: it is an ordinary process built
						on <C>SpawnMonitor</C>, <C>Down</C> and <C>Exit</C>, in the optional{' '}
						<C>grpcproc/actor</C> package. <A to="concepts/supervision/">Supervision trees</A> explains
						the strategies and what state should live outside the process so a restart can load it.

					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>Typed mailboxes.</strong> A process accepts one protobuf message type, or an
							interface over several, and its address carries that type. The compiler checks a send
							on the sending node, and the receiving node checks again on delivery, since types do not
							cross the wire.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Your gRPC server as the transport.</strong> A node is one gRPC service
							registered next to your others, with your credentials, interceptors and keepalive. Two
							nodes hold one stream in each direction, and everything between them travels on it in
							order.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>At-most-once delivery, in order per sender.</strong> A message is delivered
							once or not at all, never twice, and two messages from one sender to one receiver arrive
							in the order they were sent. A <C>Down</C> comes after the last message of the process
							it reports on. What is lost is reported where it can be: a call fails, a send to a
							process that does not exist is a dead letter.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Mailboxes that never block.</strong> A send never waits for the receiver.
							Every process on a node shares the link to a peer, so a mailbox that made it wait would
							stall the link for all of them. A mailbox is unbounded unless{' '}
							<C>WithMailboxLimit</C> bounds it, and then refuses what it has no room for: a message
							is a dead letter, a call fails with <C>ErrMailboxFull</C>. Past that, backpressure is
							the application's, and the depth of every mailbox is visible to make it one.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<Aside title="Coming from Erlang">
						<p>
							A process is a process, its pid is a <C>PID</C> with a creation number called an
							incarnation, and a registered name is per node, as in <C>register/2</C>. There is no
							selective receive: the mailbox's type is fixed at spawn, and a message of another type
							is a dead letter. <C>gen_server</C> is the <C>actor</C> package's <C>Handler</C>, with{' '}
							<C>HandleCall</C> and <C>HandleMessage</C> for <C>handle_call</C> and{' '}
							<C>handle_cast</C>; a supervisor is <C>actor.Supervise</C>, with the same strategies and
							restart types. Links are one way, as in ergo, and an exit signal is not trapped, since a
							goroutine cannot be killed. Nodes connect over gRPC streams rather than the
							distribution protocol, and there is no <C>global</C>.
