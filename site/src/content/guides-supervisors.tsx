						A <C>ChildSpec</C> says how to start one child. Three functions build one:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<C>actor.Child(name, newHandler)</C> runs an actor. It takes a factory rather than a
							handler, and calls it at every start, so a restart begins from a fresh struct. The
							factory closes over the dependencies:{' '}
							<C>func() *Inventory {'{'} return &amp;Inventory{'{'}ledger: ledger{'}'} {'}'}</C>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<C>actor.ChildFunc(name, fn)</C> runs a plain process function, for a child that is
							not an actor.
						</li>
						<li>
							<C>actor.ChildSupervisor(name, spec)</C> runs another supervisor.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The name is the child's name in the supervisor and the name it is registered under on
						the node, so it stays reachable with <C>grpcproc.Named</C> across restarts. It must be
						unique on the node. An empty name registers nothing: the child is anonymous, known by
						its PID, and a supervisor can have any number of those.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each builder takes spawn options for the child, a label say. <C>LinkChild</C> is not
						one of them: the supervisor does not trap exits, and would end whenever the child did.
						The supervisor adds <C>LinkParent</C> itself, so a child never outlives it.
					</p>

						<C>ChildSupervisor</C> is a child whose spec is another <C>Spec</C>, so an application
						can have one supervisor per service, each with its own strategy and intensity, under
						one root. The tutorial's inventory service builds its subtree in a function that takes
						the service's dependencies from the container:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/guide/internal/inventory/inventory.go">{region(inventory, /^\/\/ tree is the service's supervision tree/, /^}/)}</Code>
					<p>
						The root, in <A to="shop/platform/">the tutorial's platform</A>, is a <C>OneForOne</C>{' '}
						supervisor whose children are every service's tree. A service that gives up, past its
						own intensity, exits with <C>max restarts</C>, an abnormal reason; the root restarts that
						subtree alone, and the others carry on. A root that gives up ends the program, for
						whatever runs it to start again.
					</p>
					<p>
						A supervisor told to exit stops its children in reverse
						order, and a child supervisor has as long as it takes, <C>Infinity</C>, to stop its own.
						grpcproc cannot kill a goroutine, so a worker that outlives its <C>Shutdown</C> is
						logged and left behind; a named one keeps its name until it exits, and the supervisor
						starts it again, or ends, only once it has.

						<C>actor.StartChild(ctx, from, sup, spec)</C> adds a child to a running supervisor and
						starts it, after the children it already has; it returns the child's PID once it runs.{' '}
						<C>from</C> is who asks, the node or a process from inside its handler, as for an
						address's <C>Call</C>, and <C>sup</C> is a PID or a name. The child is the supervisor's
						like the others, with one difference: once it ends for good, because it is temporary, or
						transient and ended normally, or <C>StopChild</C> stopped it, the supervisor forgets it.
						So a pool of workers, a <C>OneForOne</C> supervisor with anonymous children added as
						they are needed, does not grow with every worker that ever ran.
					</p>
					<Code>{`worker, err := actor.StartChild(ctx, node, pool, actor.ChildFunc("", handle(job)).WithRestart(actor.Temporary))`}</Code>
					<p>
						A spec holds Go functions, which no message can carry, so <C>StartChild</C> works only
						from the supervisor's own node, which the supervisor checks: it registers the spec
						locally and calls the supervisor with its id. A child that fails to start is an error, and the supervisor does not count
						it as a restart. <C>StartChild</C> is refused while a restart waits on a stuck child,
						since the new one would start before those owed a start.
					</p>
					<p>
						A name belongs to one child. <C>StartChild</C> of a name the supervisor runs a child
						under starts nothing, and returns that child's PID with{' '}
						<C>actor.ErrAlreadyStarted</C>, whether the supervisor started it from its spec or an
						earlier <C>StartChild</C> did, and whether or not it has been restarted since. So code
						that starts a child per key keeps no map of its own, which the first restart would leave
						pointing at a process that is gone:
					</p>
					<Code>{`room, err := actor.StartChild(ctx, node, rooms, actor.Child("room:"+id, newRoom).WithRestart(actor.Transient))
if err != nil && !errors.Is(err, actor.ErrAlreadyStarted) {
	return err
}
// room runs, started now or before.`}</Code>
					<p>
						A child of that name that has just exited, and whose exit the supervisor has yet to
						handle, has freed the name already. The call waits for the supervisor to handle it, and
						gets the child's restart, or, if the supervisor forgets the child, a fresh start of the
						spec.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>actor.StopChild(ctx, from, sup, child)</C> stops a child for good: it is not
						restarted, whatever its <C>Restart</C>, and a strategy no longer counts it, until the
						supervisor itself is started again from its <C>Spec</C>. It carries a PID, so the
						supervisor may be on another node. A significant child stopped this way does not end its
						supervisor; only a child that ends by itself does.

						leaves no monitor, and no <C>Down</C> comes of it, so an error means nothing started, or
						nothing the caller will hear of. <C>actor.WithLink()</C> links the caller to the child
						instead. Either needs the caller to be a process.
					</p>
					<p>
						A call is answered at most once, and an answer can be lost: a link that breaks, a context
						that ends. The child may have started then, unwatched. A named child is found again:{' '}
						<C>StartChildFrom</C> of its name answers <C>ErrAlreadyStarted</C> with its PID and the
						monitor, as <C>StartChild</C> does. An anonymous one runs until it ends, and{' '}
						<C>actor.Children</C> lists it. The monitor is of the child's process: a restart the
						supervisor makes is a new one, which <C>StartChildFrom</C> of the name monitors again.

						A supervisor waits for a child to exit outside its receive loop, and so does every
