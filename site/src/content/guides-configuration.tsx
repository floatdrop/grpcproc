						<C>Name</C> is how peers address the node: a <C>Named</C> address is a node name and a
						process name, and a PID carries the node name too. It is unique per cluster. Two
						instances given one name are two incarnations of one node, and the newer takes the
						older's place.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Advertise</C> is the address peers dial to reach this node's gRPC server. The core
						only reports it, in <C>NodeInfo</C> and in the <C>Hello</C> that opens a link; a{' '}
						<C>Registrar</C> publishes it, and then it must be the address other hosts see, not a
						wildcard or loopback.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Incarnation</C> distinguishes this start of the node from earlier ones, and must
						grow with each start: a peer that has seen an incarnation refuses links from older
						ones, so that an instance that was replaced, and still runs, cannot take the links of
						its replacement. Zero picks the current Unix time in nanoseconds, which grows as long as
						the clocks of the hosts the node starts on agree to within the time between two starts.
						A random or hashed value would be refused whenever it came out lower than the last;
						a counter from a deployment system, or an etcd revision, works.{' '}

					<p>
						<C>DialOptions</C> are used for every outbound connection: the transport credentials,
						keepalive, and any interceptors. Keepalive is what turns a peer that went silent into a
						broken link, and it takes both halves: the dial's pings end this node's link to the
						peer, and the server's end the peer's link to this node, whose end is what declares the
						peer down, firing <C>Down</C>s and failing calls. grpcproc sets neither, because the
						server is the application's. The tutorial's platform sets both:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/guide/internal/platform/platform.go">
						{region(platform, /^\/\/ dialOptions are for every connection/, /^}/)}
					</Code>
					<Code caption="examples/guide/internal/platform/platform.go">
						{region(platform, /^func newServer/, /^}/)}
					</Code>
					<p>
						The client pings every ten seconds and gives up five seconds after an unanswered ping;
						the server's enforcement policy has to allow pings that often, and without an active
						stream, or it closes the connection for pinging too much. A partition is then a link
						error within fifteen seconds, and the calls waiting on it fail rather than hang.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>DialTimeout</C> bounds one dial, five seconds by default, as long as the resolver and
						the interceptors honour their ctx. <C>DialBackoff</C> is the longest the node waits
						before dialing a peer again after dials to it failed; meanwhile everything routed to
						the peer fails at once with <C>ErrNoConnection</C>, and a <C>Monitor</C> of a process
						there gets <C>Down{'{'}noconnection{'}'}</C> at once. The first wait is a 32nd of it,
						and each failure doubles it. A link that ends within <C>DialTimeout</C> of coming up
						counts as a failed dial, so a path that keeps breaking backs off too, rather than
						redial at every send. Set it negative to dial again at once, which is what{' '}
						<C>grpcproctest</C> does so that a test's call right after a heal reaches the peer.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>MaxQueued</C> and <C>MaxQueuedBytes</C> bound the link to each peer, which is
						unbounded by default. While a link holds that many envelopes not yet written, or that
						many bytes of message bodies, a send or a call to its peer fails at once with a{' '}
						<C>*LinkError</C> whose <C>Err</C> is <C>ErrLinkBusy</C> and whose <C>Unsent</C> is set:
						the peer cannot keep up, and the message is still on this node, for the sender to drop
						or send again later. Only that peer's senders are refused. Replies, <C>Down</C>s,
						monitors and exits are queued regardless. <C>LinkInfo.Queued</C> and{' '}
						<C>QueuedBytes</C> show how close each link is to its bound.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>MaxMessageSize</C> is the largest message the node sends a peer, 4 MiB by default:
						gRPC's <C>MaxRecvMsgSize</C>, which every peer's server must take. A peer ends a link
						that sends it more, and with it every call and monitor on the link, so a node checks
						first: a send or a call that encodes larger, metadata included, fails at once with{' '}
						<C>ErrTooLarge</C> and is never sent, and a reply that large reaches its caller as{' '}
						<C>ErrTooLarge</C>, which <C>Reply</C> returns too. Local sends are not limited. Nothing
						tells a node its peers' limits, so to carry larger messages, raise{' '}
						<C>grpc.MaxRecvMsgSize</C> on every node's server first, and <C>MaxMessageSize</C> after.

						A link is a gRPC stream, so it is secured the way the server's other services are: TLS
						or mutual TLS in the server's credentials, and the matching{' '}
						<C>grpc.WithTransportCredentials</C> in <C>DialOptions</C>. The node's identity travels
						in the stream's metadata: its name, incarnation and protocol version. Nothing checks by
						itself that the certificate a peer presents belongs to the name it claims; that is what{' '}
						<C>Admit</C> is for, and a node needs one: <C>NewNode</C> fails without it. It runs for
						every inbound link, with the peer's transport credentials in the ctx, before the link
						is accepted. <C>grpcproc.AdmitTLS</C> admits a peer whose verified client certificate
						names its node, as a DNS or IP subject alternative name, so the server must verify
						client certificates:
					</p>
					<Code>{`srv := grpc.NewServer(grpc.Creds(credentials.NewTLS(&tls.Config{
	Certificates: []tls.Certificate{cert},
	ClientCAs:    pool,
	ClientAuth:   tls.RequireAndVerifyClientCert,
})))
node, err := grpcproc.NewNode(grpcproc.Config{
	// …
	Admit: grpcproc.AdmitTLS(nil), // nil: an admitted peer may ask anything
})`}</Code>
					<p>
						A refused peer gets <C>PermissionDenied</C>, its dial fails, and it backs off like any
						other failed dial. <C>grpcproc.AdmitAll</C> admits every peer, for a network where
						whoever reaches the server is trusted: a demo on loopback, a test, a mesh that
						authenticates below gRPC. A peer it admits may claim any node name, and so stand in
						for a node, and exit any process.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Admit</C> proves who dialed this node. That the node this one dials is the one it
						meant is for the dial's credentials, as for any gRPC client: give each peer's TLS a{' '}
						<C>ServerName</C> of its node name in <C>DialOptionsFor</C>, and the peer's server
						certificate must name its node too. A certificate names a node exactly: a wildcard
						names none.
					</p>
					<p>
						An admitted peer may ask anything of any process, <C>Exit</C> included, which a process
						cannot trap. That suits the nodes of one installation. A node of another one, a
						partner's or a tenant's, gets a <C>Policy</C> instead: it judges every message, call,
						monitor and exit the peer sends over the link, by the name of the process it is for.{' '}
						<C>grpcproc.Export</C> is the usual one: the names listed, by name or PID, for sends,
						calls and monitors, and no exits. What a policy refuses does not exist for the peer: a
						call fails with <C>ErrNoProc</C>, a monitor gets <C>Down{'{'}noproc{'}'}</C>, and this
						node counts a dead letter with reason <C>denied</C>, which <C>grpcprocctl watch</C>{' '}
						shows.
					</p>
					<Code>{`Admit: func(ctx context.Context, peer grpcproc.NodeID) (grpcproc.Policy, error) {
	if _, err := grpcproc.AdmitTLS(nil)(ctx, peer); err != nil {

					<p>
						<C>DialOptionsFor</C> gives the connections to one peer options of their own, after{' '}
						<C>DialOptions</C>, so they win: the credentials for another installation's CA, here.
						Replies and <C>Down</C>s always pass a policy, since they answer what this node asked, so
						a process here can call and monitor the partner's processes whatever the partner may
						reach here. The Inspector, if the node serves one, is a second gRPC service on
						the same server and takes the same interceptors; <C>inspect.ReadOnly()</C> refuses its
						writes outright, for a deployment that shares the node's port without authenticating.{' '}
