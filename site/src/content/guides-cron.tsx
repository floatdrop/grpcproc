			on a node or under a supervisor. Every run is a process too, spawned by the cron process and
			linked to it, so a run's exit reason is its result, a run still going when the next is due can
			be left alone, skipped or replaced, and one that takes too long is told to exit. It is a

						A run is due at the start of its minute. One missed while the cron process was not
						running, or was held up, is skipped, unless its job has a <C>StartingDeadline</C>: then
						the latest run it missed starts late, if it is still within the deadline, and once,
						however many it missed. A job added to a running process owes nothing from before it was
						added, and one enabled again nothing from while it was disabled.
					</p>
					<p>
						Across processes, the cron process's state carries it. Whenever a run starts, the
						process reports each job's last run, a <C>*cronv1.State</C>, through{' '}
						<C>Spec.OnState</C>; a process started with that state as <C>Spec.Resume</C> catches up
						from there. It checks the minute it starts in at once: a run due in it, which the process
						it takes over from did not start, starts then rather than a minute late. A supervisor
						that restarts a cron process resumes it from its last state by itself.
