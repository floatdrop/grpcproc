					<p>
						The distributed deployment splits the same modules between three entry points: the front
						takes the orders and serves HTTP, the warehouse keeps the stock, and billing takes the
						payments. Each <C>main</C> is one line.
					</p>
					<Code caption="cmd/front/main.go">{front}</Code>

						The front's placement puts the inventory on <C>warehouse</C> and the payments on{' '}
						<C>billing</C>, so the desk's addresses name those nodes; nothing in the desk changed.
						The warehouse and billing are told the front's address although they never call it,
						because a reply travels back on the replier's own link. A placement naming a node not
						among the peers is refused at start.

					<p>Each node's tree holds only the services its entry point composed:</p>
					<Code lang="txt" caption="what each node runs">
						{clusterTree}
					</Code>
					<p>
						Here the peers are a static list. A link that breaks fires a <C>Down</C> for every
						process monitored across it and fails the calls waiting on it. While dials to a node
						fail, calls to it fail at once, and it is dialed again within five seconds, so a
						restarted warehouse is back in the front's orders soon after it starts. For nodes that
						come and go,{' '}
						<Ext href={`${REPO}/tree/main/etcd`}>
							<C>grpcproc/etcd</C>
						</Ext>{' '}
						publishes each node under an etcd lease and resolves the others through it; the platform
						takes its resolver, registrar and membership from there, and the services do not
						change. The <A to="guides/etcd/">etcd</A> guide shows how.
