							<strong>Pre-votes</strong> come first: a node asks whether it would win before it
							starts a term, so a node cut off from the others does not raise its term alone and
							depose the leader once it is back.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>A leader steps down</strong> once it has not heard from a majority for two
							election timeouts.

							<strong>Followers stick</strong> to a leader they heard from within an election
							timeout, and ignore requests for votes, unless the leader handed over.

							peer's elector. A send or a monitor that waits for a dial to a node that does not
							answer holds that relay, never the elector and its heartbeats. When a leader's
							elector exits, its followers see it at once, and campaign without waiting out a
							timeout.

lease.Save(state)                   // the same, without the wait`}</Code>
					<p>
						The leader sends the state to its followers with its heartbeats, and a follower votes
						only for a candidate whose state is at least as recent as its own. So whichever node
						leads next starts its singleton from every checkpoint that returned, or a later one.
						Once the lease's term is over, <C>Checkpoint</C> fails with <C>leader.ErrNotLeader</C>,
						and nothing a demoted singleton saves reaches anyone.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>leader.Resign(ctx, node, cluster)</C> hands over. The leader stops its singleton,
						whose <C>Terminate</C> can still save; waits for the follower with the latest state to
						hold the leader's; and has it campaign at once. Call it before stopping a leader's
						node, and the next leader starts from what <C>Terminate</C> saved rather than the last
						checkpoint. On a node that does not lead it is <C>ErrNotLeader</C>, and on a leader
						alone, <C>ErrNoSuccessor</C>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Keep the state to what the next leader needs to carry on, the jobs a scheduler ran last,
						not the data they worked on: every checkpoint carries all of it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Without a <C>Store</C>, the state lives in memory, as do the terms: a cluster that loses
						a majority of its nodes at once loses them, and a cluster of one loses them at every
						restart. With one on each node, each keeps its term, its vote and the state, and saves
						them before it tells anyone of them, as Raft does. A cluster that restarts whole starts
						its singleton from the last checkpoint that returned, and its terms go on growing.
					</p>
					<Code>{`Store: leader.File("/var/lib/app/cron.election"), // each node its own, on its own disk`}</Code>
					<p>
						A <C>Store</C> shared by nodes breaks the election, and so does a file restored from a
						backup, which has forgotten the votes cast since: delete it instead, and the node starts
						afresh.

					<p>
						The example's test asks from every node, kills the leader, and asks again: the numbers

						Repeating a call that may have been handled is the caller's choice: fine for a read, or

						cordoned, and ends with <C>ErrNoSuccessor</C> if that follower cannot be reached.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Cordon</C> keeps a node from leading until <C>Uncordon</C>: it campaigns no more,
						voters refuse it, and if it leads, it hands over. The cordoned nodes are part of the
						state the leader replicates, and <C>Cordon</C> returns once a majority holds it, so a
						cordon outlasts the cordoned node's restarts, and the leader's. A cordoned node still
						votes, so the cluster keeps its quorum while its host is worked on. A cordon that would
						leave no node of the view to lead is refused.
