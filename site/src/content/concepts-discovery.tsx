						<C>Resolver</C> is required; the other two are optional. A node with only a resolver
						works: it dials peers as it needs them and notices a lost one through its links. The
						other two are for clusters whose nodes come and go, and for failures the links cannot
						see.

					<p>
						<C>StaticResolver</C> is a map from node name to address, and <C>ResolverFunc</C> adapts
						a function. Either is enough for a fixed set of programs whose addresses are in their
						configuration. The tutorial's platform builds one from what the program is told:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/guide/internal/platform/platform.go">
						{region(platform, /^\/\/ peers resolves the other nodes/, /^}/)}
					</Code>
					<p>
						<C>Resolve</C> runs once per dial, not per message: a node keeps its stream to a peer
						open, and asks again only when it has to dial again. It must return once its ctx is
						done, since that ctx is what bounds a dial. An address a resolver returns is whatever
						the node's <C>DialOptions</C> can dial: a host and port, or a target a gRPC name
						resolver understands.
					</p>

			id: 'registrar',
			title: 'Registrar and metadata',
			body: (

					<p>
						<C>Config.Advertise</C> is the address peers dial to reach this node's gRPC server. The
						core does not use it to listen, since the server is the application's; it reports it
						in <C>NodeInfo</C> and hands it to the <C>Registrar</C> as the member's <C>Addr</C>.
						Peers then resolve this node to it.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Start</C> registers after it has begun watching membership, so that no event is
						missed between the two, and <C>Stop</C> withdraws last, after the node's processes have
						exited and their <C>Down</C> notices have reached its peers: peers that saw the node
						leave the cluster first would report <C>noconnection</C> instead of{' '}
						<C>shutdown</C>. An error from <C>Register</C>{' '}
						must leave the node unpublished, because <C>Start</C> may call it again.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Config.Metadata</C> goes with the member: the application's version, its zone,
						whatever choosing a node for work decides by. grpcproc reads none of it, and it is fixed
						for the node's life, so a new version is a new start. A <C>Membership</C> that carries it
						brings it to every node, where <C>node.Members()</C> lists the members it reports up,
						each with its metadata, this node included:
					</p>
					<Code>{`node, _ := grpcproc.NewNode(grpcproc.Config{
	Name:     "orders-3",
	Metadata: map[string]string{"version": buildVersion, "zone": "eu-1"},
	// Resolver, Registrar, Membership, Admit …
})

// Later: start the child on a node of this zone that runs the new version.
for _, m := range node.Members() {
	if m.Metadata["zone"] == "eu-1" && m.Metadata["version"] == buildVersion {
		// actor.StartChildFrom(ctx, node, grpcproc.Name{Node: m.Name, Name: "workers"}, "worker", arg)
	}
}`}</Code>
					<p>
						<C>NodeInfo.Metadata</C> and the Inspector show a node's own, so a rollout can be
						followed node by node. Metadata is what a node says about itself, not what it has
						proven: authorization decides by credentials, in <C>Config.Admit</C>.

					<p>
						A node notices a lost link by itself, as fast as gRPC keepalive allows. That signal is
						local: a peer that dies without closing its connections is noticed only when keepalive
						gives up, or never if keepalive is not configured, and a broken link does not say
						whether the peer is gone or only unreachable from here.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Membership</C> is the cluster-wide verdict on top of that. With etcd, it is the
						peer's lease expiring: every node watching the cluster learns of it at once, whatever
						its own link was doing. Erlang has the same split, between the <C>net_kernel</C> tick
						that guards one connection and an external registry that decides who is in.
					</p>
					<p>When the node's watch reports a change, the node acts on it:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							a member <em>down</em>, for the incarnation the node has streams to, drops those
							streams: monitors across them fire <C>Down{'{'}noconnection{'}'}</C>, links end their
							processes, and pending calls fail with <C>ErrNoConnection</C> and the cause, "left the
							cluster";
						</li>
						<li>
							a member <em>up</em> as a newer incarnation than the one the node has streams to drops
							them the same way, with the cause "restarted as incarnation N", and the next send dials
							the new instance;
						</li>
						<li>
							a member up as an older incarnation than the node has seen is ignored, as a stream
							from it would be refused; see{' '}
							<A to="concepts/nodes/#incarnations">incarnations</A>;
						</li>
						<li>
							a member up, unless it is an older incarnation than the node has seen, ends any dial
							backoff for that peer.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						A down with incarnation zero means whichever incarnation it was; an up with zero, one
						not known. The node forgets the newest incarnation it saw of a peer when membership
						reports that one gone, which is what lets an instance with an older incarnation, or a
						clock behind the last one's, join again.

						<A to="guides/etcd/">grpcproc/etcd</A> implements the three on one <C>Cluster</C> value:

						and a deployment that wants another registry implements the same three interfaces. The
						tutorial's <A to="tutorial/platform/">platform</A> takes its resolver, registrar and
