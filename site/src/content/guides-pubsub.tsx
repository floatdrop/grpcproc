						A topic is a process that keeps its subscribers and the last <C>Config.Buffer</C>{' '}
						events, and sends each event it is given to every subscriber. It is spawned in one of
						two ways:
					</p>
					<Table
						rows={[
							[
								<C>pubsub.SpawnOwned[E](p, cfg, …)</C>,
								<>
									A topic owned by <C>p</C>, linked to it: it ends when <C>p</C> does, with{' '}

								</>

								'A topic for the whole node, whoever publishes to it. It lasts until it is asked to exit or the node stops.'

						The rest of the arguments are <C>grpcproc.SpawnOption</C>s: a name, a label. The example's
						inventory owns a topic of stock levels and publishes to it after each reservation:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/pubsub/main.go">{region(example, /^\/\/ inventory reserves stock/, /^}/)}</Code>
					<p>
						<C>Publish(ctx, from, e)</C> is a send to the topic, from a <C>Node</C> or a{' '}
						<C>Process</C>, as <C>Addr.Send</C> is. The topic sends each event on in the order it
						received them, so one publisher's events arrive in the order it published them, each
						with the metadata it was published with, trace context included.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>Topic[E]</C> is an address that carries the event type, as <C>Addr[M]</C> carries a
						mailbox's: <C>pubsub.Named[E](node, name)</C> reaches a topic by its name, and{' '}
						<C>pubsub.TopicOf[E](pid)</C> by its PID. <C>topic.Addr()</C> is its process, to monitor,
						link to, or ask to exit. A topic whose <C>E</C> is an interface, <C>proto.Message</C>{' '}
						say, takes any message of it.

						twice. The events are plain messages, from <C>sub.From</C>, so <C>p</C>'s mailbox must

					<p>
						A process that subscribes to a topic of another node subscribes through a relay on its
						own node: a process named <C>{'pubsub:{stock@warehouse}'}</C>, which the first such
						subscriber starts. The relay is a topic too. Its events are the upstream topic's, and it
						keeps as many as the upstream does, so the second subscriber on a node gets the kept
						events without another trip across the network. The upstream topic sends each event
						once to each node, however many subscribers the node has.
					</p>
					<p>
						For the subscriber, <C>sub.From</C> is the relay, and the{' '}
						<C>Down</C> comes from the relay, with the topic's reason: the relay ends with the topic,
						for the same reason, and ends as well when its last subscriber leaves, after which the
						topic forgets it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The relay subscribes to the topic while its first subscriber waits, within that
						subscriber's deadline: a call carries its <C>ctx</C>'s deadline to the process called,
						so the relay gives up when the subscriber does. Give <C>Subscribe</C> a
						deadline, as the dashboard does: with none, the relay waits until the topic answers or
						its node becomes unreachable. A topic that does not exist is <C>ErrNoProc</C>, and a node
						that cannot be reached <C>ErrNoConnection</C>, as for a call.

						reaches it as it is published; and when inventory is asked to exit, the dashboard is
						told the topic ended, and why.
