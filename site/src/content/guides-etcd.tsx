					<p>
						A node that registers a name already present replaces it: a restarted node supersedes
						its previous incarnation, whose lease may not have expired yet. Its peers see the new
						incarnation come up and drop their links to the old one, with the cause "restarted as
						incarnation N", so a fast restart is not mistaken for a node that was never gone.
					</p>
					<p>
						An older incarnation never replaces a newer one's record, which a compare-and-swap
						settles. <C>Register</C> fails with <C>ErrSuperseded</C> while a newer one holds the key,
						and an instance that was replaced, and comes back to etcd after losing its lease, stops
						registering when it finds a newer incarnation registered, rather than take the name
						back. Peers that have seen the newer one refuse the old one's links too, as{' '}
						<A to="concepts/nodes/#incarnations">Nodes and the cluster</A> explains. Incarnations
						must therefore grow with each start: with the default, the start time, the hosts'
						clocks must agree to within the time between two starts of a node.

				<>
					<p>
						grpcproc notices a lost link by itself, as fast as gRPC keepalive allows — or never, for
						a node that died without closing its connections where keepalive is not configured. Its
						lease ends after the TTL regardless: every watching node then drops its links, monitors
						across them fire <C>Down{'{'}noconnection{'}'}</C>, and pending calls fail with "left
						the cluster". The lease is the verdict the whole cluster shares; a broken link is one
						node's view.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both signals are worth having. Keepalive is faster and needs no round trip to etcd; set
						it in the node's <C>DialOptions</C> and on the server, as{' '}
						<A to="guides/configuration/#connections">Configuring a node</A> shows. The lease catches
						what keepalive misses, and it is what removes a dead node from the addresses peers
						resolve.

						<A to="concepts/addressing/#global">global names</A>: one key per name,{' '}
						<C>&lt;prefix&gt;/names/&lt;name&gt;</C>, holding its holder's PID, under the lease of the
						holder's node, so a node that dies takes its names with it as its peers drop their links
						to it. A claim is a transaction that creates the key; a release deletes it if its create
						revision is still the claim's, which is also the fencing token. Every node of a program
						shares one copy of the names, listed a page at a time when the first starts and kept by
						a watch, so a send to a global name never waits on etcd.
					</p>
					<p>
						A node's claims are lost once its lease has not been kept alive for three quarters of
						the TTL: their holders end with <C>name lost</C> before etcd can let the lease end and
						another node claim the names. Claims made with <C>KeepOnLoss</C> keep their holders
						running, and are made again together once the node has registered again: a key that
						outlived the old lease moves to the new one with its revision, and a name another process
						took meanwhile ends the holder with <C>name conflict</C>.
