							<strong>The same message</strong>, <C>wrapperspb.Int64Value</C>, because Hollywood and
							Proto.Actor need protobuf to go remote. Ergo's network registers struct values and not
							pointers, so it sends a struct holding the same <C>int64</C>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Send</strong> is end-to-end throughput: the timer stops when the receiver has
							counted every message, not when the sender has queued them.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Request</strong> is one caller waiting for each reply; <strong>parallel</strong>{' '}
							is <C>RunParallel</C> callers against one echo.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Remote</strong> is two engines, systems or nodes over real TCP on loopback, the
							connection warmed up before timing. grpcproc's own benchmarks in the root module use
							in-memory connections, which would favour it here. GoAkt's remote actors are found with
							the public <C>PID.RemoteLookup</C> and reached through its remoting client, as an
							application would; Ergo's nodes find each other through its embedded registrar, on a
							port of their own.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Each framework is its own package: Hollywood and Proto.Actor both register a protobuf file
						named <C>actor.proto</C>, which cannot share a binary, and separate binaries also keep one
						framework's globals, Proto.Actor replaces gRPC's logger, out of another's numbers.

					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>The transport decides sequential remote latency.</strong> GoAkt, with its own
							TCP protocol, and Hollywood, with dRPC, answer a remote request in 36 to 38 µs; the two
							that speak gRPC take longer, grpcproc 45 µs and Proto.Actor 61 µs. gRPC-go's writer
							adds a goroutine hand-off in each direction. On a real network the round trip dwarfs
							the difference; for grpcproc it is the cost of living on the application's gRPC server.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Against the other gRPC library</strong>, grpcproc answers a remote request 26%
							sooner than Proto.Actor and trails it by about 40 ns on remote send, where Proto.Actor's
							writer batches up to a thousand envelopes.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Locally</strong>, a grpcproc call waits on one channel of its own where Hollywood
							and Proto.Actor create a temporary process per request, which puts it three times ahead
							of them. GoAkt is quicker still, with as many allocations per call.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Ergo starts a goroutine per hop.</strong> A sleeping process runs on a new
							goroutine each time a message wakes it, and so does each connection's read queue and
							each write flush. A request finds its echo asleep every time, so a local one takes
							3.2 µs and a remote one 50 µs, over Ergo's own TCP protocol; a stream of sends keeps
							the sink awake. Its remote calls allocate least of all, and it is second only to
							Hollywood on parallel requests.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>Hollywood's sends are fastest</strong> everywhere, with a lighter transport and
							vtprotobuf-generated envelopes. grpcproc also pays, on every message, for what its
							Inspector reports: per-process counters, mailbox ages, and a type check on delivery.
						</li>

					<p>
						Ergo runs with its software keepalive off, the one default changed. With it on, parallel
						remote requests timed out in 8 runs of 16: each connection's flusher arms one{' '}
						<C>time.AfterFunc</C> timer from its writers (500 ns) and from its own callback (15 s, the
						keepalive), and on Go 1.26.0 and 1.27.1 a <C>Reset</C> to 500 ns is now and then lost when
						more than one P runs. The batch of calls then sits unsent until another timer runs, at
						worst the keepalive, past Ergo's 5 s call timeout. The standard library alone reproduces
						it. The keepalive sends nothing while messages flow, so the numbers are still Ergo's.
