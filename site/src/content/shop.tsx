				<>
					<p>
						The shop takes orders over HTTP, reserves stock and charges a card. Its services are
						grpcproc processes, built and wired by{' '}
						<Ext href="https://github.com/yandex/di">golang.yandex/di</Ext>, a dependency-injection
						container. The same code runs as one program, for development, or as three programs on
						three nodes, as deployed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every file shown is from{' '}
						<Ext href={`${REPO}/tree/main/examples/guide`}>
							<C>examples/guide</C>
						</Ext>{' '}
						in the repository, and every output is pinned by its tests.

			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						The shop's code comes in four kinds of package. A <em>service</em> exports one function,{' '}
						<C>Module</C>, which registers with the container what the service needs and, if it runs
						processes, their supervision tree. A <em>contract</em> is the messages a service's
						process accepts and the name it is registered under; it is all another service may
						import. The <em>platform</em> is what every program runs. An <em>entry point</em> is a{' '}
						<C>main</C> that picks the services.
					</p>
					<Code lang="txt" caption="examples/guide">
						{treeText}
					</Code>
					<p>
						No service knows where the others run. The orders service reaches the inventory through
						the inventory's contract and a node name from the placement in the configuration, which
						says which node runs each service. The shop as one program and the shop as three differ
						in two things only: which services each entry point composes, and what each program is
						told.

		{
			id: 'contracts',
			title: 'Contracts',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						A contract is a protobuf package: the messages a service's process accepts and answers.
						A mailbox holds one message type, so the stock takes a <C>Command</C> whose oneof
						carries each operation: a reservation, a call answered with <C>Reserved</C>, and a
						release, a send nobody waits for.
					</p>
					<Code lang="proto" caption="proto/inventory/v1/inventory.proto">
						{inventoryProto}
					</Code>
					<p>
						A refusal is part of the answer: <C>Reserved</C> says what is left, or why nothing was
						reserved, so an error means the stock failed, not that it said no. The registered name
						is part of the contract too. The package exports the address as a type of its own, made
						from a node name: it embeds <C>Addr[*Command]</C>, so the compiler checks every send to
						it, wherever the process runs. Its methods are the protocol: <C>Reserve</C> is a call
						answered with <C>Reserved</C>, <C>Release</C> is a send, and the <C>Command</C> around
						each is wrapped here, once. Each takes its sender, a node or a process, as a{' '}
						<C>grpcproc.Caller</C>.
