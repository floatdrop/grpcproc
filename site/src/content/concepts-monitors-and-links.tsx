					<p>
						<C>p.Monitor(target)</C> watches a process. When the target exits, <C>p</C> receives a
						message with <C>Down</C> set, through the same <C>Receive</C> as everything else. The
						target can be a PID, a name on some node, or a typed address; it can run on this node
						or on any other, and the watcher's code is the same.
					</p>
					<Code>{`ref := p.Monitor(grpcproc.Named[*shoppb.Reserve]("warehouse", "stock"))

m, err := p.Receive()
if err != nil {
	return err
}
if m.Down != nil && m.Down.Ref == ref {
	p.Log().Info("stock is gone", "reason", m.Down.Reason)
}`}</Code>
					<p>
						<C>Monitor</C> returns a <C>Ref</C>, and the <C>Down</C> carries it back, so a process
						that watches several targets tells their notices apart. The <C>Down</C> also carries the{' '}
						<C>PID</C> that exited, the <C>Name</C> the monitor was placed by, if it was, and the{' '}
						<C>Reason</C>. <C>Demonitor(ref)</C> stops watching; a <C>Down</C> already in the mailbox
						stays there.
					</p>
					<p>
						Two cases need no exit at all. A monitor on a process that does not exist, because it
						never did or already went, answers at once with reason <C>noproc</C>. A monitor on a
						process whose node cannot be reached, now or later, answers with <C>noconnection</C>,
						the moment the node is declared down. In both the watcher gets exactly one <C>Down</C>.

					<p>
						A process's <C>Down</C> arrives after every message that process sent to the watcher.
						When a worker sends its result and then exits, the watcher sees the result, then the{' '}
						<C>Down</C>, and after the <C>Down</C> nothing more comes.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within a node it holds because the <C>Down</C> is queued in the watcher's mailbox like a
						message, by the same code, behind what came before. Across nodes it holds because
						everything one node sends to another travels on one gRPC stream, in order: messages,
						replies, monitor notices. <A to="concepts/nodes/">Nodes and links</A> has the link in
						detail.
					</p>
					<p>
						The quick start's watcher monitors the stock, asks it to exit, and next receives the{' '}
						<C>Down</C>, with the reason it asked for:

			title: 'Spawning monitored',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						There is a gap between <C>Spawn</C> returning an address and <C>Monitor</C> being called
						on it. A child that exits inside that gap is reported as <C>noproc</C>, and its real
						reason is lost: a supervisor would take a transient child's clean, immediate exit for a
						crash and restart it in a loop.
					</p>
					<p>
						<C>p.SpawnMonitor(fn)</C> closes the gap: it spawns the child and monitors it in one
						step, inside the section that admits the child, so the monitor exists before the child
						runs. However soon the child exits, the <C>Down</C> has its real reason. It is Erlang's{' '}
						<C>spawn_monitor</C>, and it is how <A to="concepts/supervision/">supervisors</A> start
						every child.
					</p>
					<Code>{`child, ref, err := p.SpawnMonitor(worker, grpcproc.WithLabel("worker"))
if err != nil {
	return err
}
// A Down with ref arrives when child exits, with its reason, even
// if it exits before this line runs.`}</Code>
					<p>
						A child of another node has the same gap, wider: the process that starts it is there,
						answering a call. The caller asks for the monitor with the call, with{' '}
						<C>addr.CallMonitor</C>, and the callee spawns with <C>grpcproc.WatchedBy(m)</C>, which
						places it on the child inside the same critical section, before the child runs. The
						answer names the child, and a <C>Down</C> that came before it waits for it, so it comes
						after the answer with its real reason. Only a successful answer brings the monitor: a
						call that fails leaves none, so a spawn that failed is an error and a child that started
						and died is a <C>Down</C>. <C>addr.CallLink</C> links the caller instead, as{' '}
						<C>LinkChild</C> does, and <C>m.Watch(pid)</C> places either on a process that runs
						already.
					</p>
					<Code>{`// On the caller's node.
placed, ref, err := placer.CallMonitor[*roomspb.Placed](ctx, p, &roomspb.Place{Peer: id})

// On the callee's: the placer, answering the call m.
peer, err := p.Spawn(runPeer, grpcproc.WatchedBy(m))
if err != nil {
	return m.Reply(nil, err)
}
return m.Reply(&roomspb.Placed{Peer: peer.PID().Proto()}, nil)`}</Code>

						A supervisor does this for a child it builds from a factory, with{' '}

		{
			id: 'exit',
			title: 'Exit requests',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						<C>p.Exit(target, reason)</C> asks a process anywhere to stop, with a reason of the
						caller's choosing; <C>node.Exit(ctx, target, reason)</C> does the same from outside a
						process. The target's context is cancelled with the reason as its cause, its next{' '}
						<C>Receive</C> returns an <C>*ExitError</C>, and it returns. Its watchers get a{' '}
						<C>Down</C> with that reason, its supervisor decides from the reason whether to start it
						again, and the node stops its processes this way, with <C>shutdown</C>.
					</p>
					<Code>{`m, err := p.Receive()
if err != nil {
	// After Exit: err is an *ExitError, and context.Cause(p.Context())
	// is the same value. Return it, and the reason is the process's.
	return err
}`}</Code>
					<p>
						A goroutine cannot be killed from outside, so the request is delivered as the error
						above and the process is expected to return. Trapping exits does not turn it into a
						message: if it could, a process could keep running through the node's shutdown. A
						process that needs to clean up does so after <C>Receive</C> returns, or in an actor's{' '}
						<C>Terminate</C>.

			id: 'link',
			title: 'Links',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						<C>p.Link(target)</C> is for a process that would only stop on a <C>Down</C>: a session
						that serves one connection, a worker that feeds one consumer. When the target exits,{' '}
						<C>p</C> exits too, with the target's reason, whatever it is.
					</p>
					<Code>{`// A session cannot outlive the connection process it serves.
p.Link(conn)

// A target that does not exist ends p with noproc; one whose node
// cannot be reached, now or later, ends it with noconnection.`}</Code>
					<p>
						A link is one way. <C>p.Link(b)</C> ties <C>p</C>'s fate to <C>b</C>'s and says nothing
						about <C>b</C>: when <C>p</C> exits, <C>b</C> is not affected. If <C>b</C> should follow{' '}
						<C>p</C> as well, <C>b</C> links to <C>p</C>. <C>Unlink(target)</C> removes a link; an{' '}
						<C>Exited</C> already in the mailbox stays there, as a <C>Down</C> does.
					</p>
					<p>
						The linker takes the reason as it is, <C>normal</C> included: a target that finished
						cleanly is gone all the same. So a child linked to a supervisor that was stopped in an
						orderly way still goes, and a transient child whose dependency ended <C>normal</C>{' '}
						ended normally too, so its own supervisor does not restart it.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the wire a link is a monitor. Only the linker's node tells the two apart: when the{' '}
						<C>Down</C> arrives, a monitor's is queued as a message and a link's ends the process,
						the way an <C>Exit</C> request would. So a link gets everything a monitor gets, the{' '}
						<C>noproc</C> and <C>noconnection</C> cases and the ordering behind the target's last
						messages, and a peer on another node needs nothing beyond monitors.

		{
			id: 'spawn-linked',
			title: 'Spawning linked',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						A link placed after <C>Spawn</C> has the same gap a monitor has, so links to a child are
						made at spawn, by option. <C>LinkParent()</C> links the child to the process that spawns
						it: when the parent exits, the child does too. <C>LinkChild()</C> links the parent to the
						child: when the child exits, the parent does. Both together are Erlang's{' '}
						<C>spawn_link</C>, a link both ways.
					</p>
					<Code>{`// A helper that must not outlive p, and whose failure must not end p.
helper, err := p.Spawn(fetch, grpcproc.LinkParent())

// A pair that live and die together.
twin, err := p.Spawn(other, grpcproc.LinkParent(), grpcproc.LinkChild())`}</Code>
					<p>
						Both options need a parent, so they are for <C>Process.Spawn</C> and{' '}
						<C>SpawnMonitor</C>; <C>Node.Spawn</C>, which no process calls, refuses them. A supervisor
						spawns each child with <C>LinkParent</C>, so a supervisor that is gone takes its children
						with it even if the orderly stop it makes when it ends did not reach them.

			title: 'Trapping exits',
			body: (
				<>
					<p>
						A process that wants to know when a linked process exits, and do something other than
						exit, calls <C>p.SetTrapExit(true)</C>. From then on, the exit of a process it is linked
						to arrives as a message with <C>Exited</C> set, in order with the rest, instead of ending
						it. <C>Exited</C> carries the <C>PID</C>, the <C>Name</C> the link was placed by, if it
						was, and the <C>Reason</C>; <C>p.TrapExit()</C> reports the setting.
					</p>
					<Code>{`p.SetTrapExit(true)
for {
	m, err := p.Receive()
	if err != nil {
		return err // an Exit request: still not a message
	}
	if m.Exited != nil {
		p.Log().Warn("a linked process exited", "pid", m.Exited.PID, "reason", m.Exited.Reason)
		continue
	}
	// …
}`}</Code>
					<p>
						Trapping applies to links only. An <C>Exit</C> request still ends the process. And an
						actor run by <C>actor.Run</C> still
						ends when its parent exits, whether it traps or not, as a <C>gen_server</C> does; that
						rule lives in the actor loop, and a raw process that traps exits decides for itself.

					<Aside title="Coming from Erlang">
						<p>
							Two things differ. A link is one way, as in{' '}
							<Ext href="https://ergo.services">ergo</Ext>. Erlang's two-way link needs the rule that a non-trapping process
							ignores a <C>normal</C> exit, or a helper that finishes would take its parent with it;
							and it needs both nodes to agree on the link, which is why the link protocol gained
							unlink ids and acknowledgements in OTP 23. A one-way link is a monitor on the wire,
							which each side handles alone. And an exit signal from <C>Exit</C> is never trapped,
							where Erlang's <C>exit/2</C> is, unless the reason is <C>kill</C>: grpcproc cannot kill
							a goroutine, so the request is the only <C>kill</C> it has. The{' '}
							<Ext href={file('docs/DESIGN.md')}>design notes</Ext> have the reasoning.
