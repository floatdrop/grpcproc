						Delivery is at most once. A <C>Send</C> that returns <C>nil</C> was handed to delivery,
						which means the mailbox for a local process and the link's queue for a remote one; a{' '}
						<C>Call</C> that returns a reply was handled. For any other outcome, the error says
						whether the callee saw the request, where that is known:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<strong>A <C>*LinkError</C> with <C>Unsent</C> set</strong> says no. The peer could
							not be reached, dials to it are backed off, or its link is full, and the message is
							still on this node. Sending it again cannot deliver it twice.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong>A <C>*LinkError</C> without it</strong> says the message may have been
							handled: the link broke while the call waited for its reply. So does a call that
							ended with its context, and one that was waiting when its node stopped, which fails
							with <C>ErrNodeStopped</C>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong><C>ErrNoProc</C></strong> says no when the process did not exist, and maybe
							when the callee exited before answering: it may have done the work and crashed on the
							reply.
						</li>
						<li>
							<strong><C>ErrType</C> and a <C>*RemoteError</C></strong> say the callee saw the
							request, refused it, or handled it and returned an error.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						<C>Unsent</C> is the field, rather than <C>Sent</C>, so that a <C>LinkError</C> built
						without it claims nothing. A caller that retries on anything else risks doing the work
						twice; whether that is safe depends on the handler. The tutorial's desk does not retry:
						on an error it leaves things as they are, logs the order for reconciliation, and fails
						the call.

						the message against the mailbox's on delivery, local or remote, because an address's
						type is the sender's claim and does not cross the wire. What a process does with a well-typed message it does not

						<A to="guides/configuration/#security">Security</A>), to one whose mailbox is full{' '}
