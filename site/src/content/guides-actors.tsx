					<p>
						A process is a receive loop with a switch in it, which suits one that does one thing.
						For a service, the switch grows a case per operation. An actor is a struct holding its
						dependencies and its state, with a method per kind of message: one for messages, one
						for calls, one for the exit of something it watches. A constructor builds the struct,
						so a DI container can, and <C>actor.Run</C> is the loop.
					</p>
					<Code>{`type Orders struct{ repo *Repo }

func NewOrders(repo *Repo) *Orders { return &Orders{repo: repo} }

func (o *Orders) HandleMessage(p *grpcproc.Process[*orderspb.Order], m grpcproc.Msg[*orderspb.Order]) error {
	return o.repo.Save(p.Context(), m.Body)
}

addr, err := node.Spawn(actor.Run(NewOrders(repo)), grpcproc.WithName("orders"))`}</Code>
					<p>
						<C>Run</C> turns the handler into a process function, the one <C>Spawn</C> takes, so an
						actor is spawned, named, monitored and addressed like any process.

						All of them run on the actor's goroutine, one at a time, in the order the messages

					<p>
						From <C>HandleCall</C>, an error is the answer: the caller gets it as a{' '}
						<C>*RemoteError</C>, and the actor goes on to the next message. Use it for a refused
						reservation or a bad quantity, which are not the actor's failure.
					</p>
					<p>
						From <C>HandleMessage</C>, <C>HandleDown</C> and <C>HandleExited</C>, an error is the
						exit reason: nobody waits for an answer to a send, so the error goes to the actor's
						supervisor, which sees a crash and starts a fresh actor. So keep what must survive
						outside the actor, in the dependency the constructor takes, and load it in{' '}
						<C>Init</C>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Two sentinel errors are exceptions. <C>actor.ErrStop</C> from any handler ends the
						actor with reason <C>normal</C>; from <C>HandleCall</C>, the reply is sent first, so a
						caller that asked the actor to stop gets its answer. <C>actor.ErrNoReply</C> from{' '}
						<C>HandleCall</C> sends nothing: the actor keeps the message and answers later with{' '}
						<C>m.Reply(resp, err)</C>, from a later handler or from any goroutine. The caller waits
						until then, or until its context ends; <C>m.Deadline()</C> says when that is, so an

						The example's actor holds a stock and records reservations in a <C>Ledger</C>, its one
						dependency. Its mailbox holds <C>*shoppb.Stock</C>, a oneof of a reservation and a
						restock:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/actors/main.go">{region(actors, /^\/\/ Inventory is an actor/, /^}/) + '\n\n' + region(actors, /^\/\/ Init runs on the actor/, /^}/)}</Code>
					<p>
						A reservation is a call. When there is not enough stock, the actor parks the message
						and returns <C>ErrNoReply</C>; the caller waits, and gets its answer when a restock
						arrives:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/actors/main.go">{region(actors, /^\/\/ HandleCall gets what was sent/, /^}/)}</Code>
					<p>
						A restock is a send. <C>HandleMessage</C> adds the stock and answers the parked calls
						it now can, each with its own <C>Reply</C>. A reservation that arrives as a send breaks the
						protocol, and the returned error ends the actor:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/actors/main.go">{region(actors, /^\/\/ HandleMessage gets what was sent/, /^}/)}</Code>
					<p>
						<C>Terminate</C> runs however the actor ends. The calls it never answered need no
						handling here: a caller whose callee exits gets <C>ErrNoProc</C> on its own.
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/actors/main.go">{region(actors, /^\/\/ Terminate runs however/, /^}/)}</Code>
					<p>
						The program spawns the actor under a name and calls it through a{' '}
						<C>shoppb.StockAddr</C>, whose methods are its protocol (
						<A to="concepts/addressing/#protocol">an address with its protocol</A>). It parks a
						reservation until a restock, gets a refusal back as an error, then breaks the protocol
						with a raw <C>Stock</C> that the address's methods would not send:
					</p>
					<Code caption="examples/actors/main.go">{region(actors, /addr, err := node.Spawn\(actor.Run/, /fmt.Println\("then:", err\)/)}</Code>
					<Output>{actorsOutput}</Output>
					<p>
						The last line is the reservation queued behind the one that was sent: the actor had exited by
						the time it was next in the mailbox, so the call failed with <C>ErrNoProc</C>. Under a
						supervisor, a new actor would be running by then, under the same name, with a fresh
						state; <A to="guides/supervisors/">Supervisors</A> shows that.

						can be trapped, as any link can, with <C>p.SetTrapExit(true)</C> in <C>Init</C>, after
						which a linked process's exit arrives as an <C>Exited</C> message.
					</p>
					<p>
						An <C>Exited</C> from the actor's own parent is the exception: it ends the actor, with
						the parent's reason, before <C>HandleExited</C> sees it, as a <C>gen_server</C> ends
						when its parent does, so no subtree outlives its supervisor. That rule is in{' '}
						<C>actor.Run</C>, not in the core; a plain process that traps exits decides for
