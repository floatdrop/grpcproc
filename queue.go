// queue is an unbounded multi-producer, single-consumer queue. Unbounded is
// deliberate: like Erlang, a send never blocks, which rules out distributed
// deadlocks and keeps one slow process from stalling the link it shares. A
// link's queue may be bounded all the same (see offer), since its link is
// its own: a full one refuses an item rather than block its producer.
//
// Producers append to in under the mutex. The consumer owns out: when it
// runs dry, it swaps in for it, so the consumer takes the lock once per batch
// rather than once per item, and the two buffers are reused, so a queue that
// is kept up with allocates nothing.
//
// A stamped queue also knows how long its oldest item has waited and when
// the consumer took what it is working on, reading the clock once per batch
// rather than per item: when in goes from empty to holding something (the
// oldest item of that batch, exactly), and when the consumer takes a batch.
