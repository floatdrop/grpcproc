# examples

A module of its own, built against the working tree, so every program here
compiles with the grpcproc next to it. CI runs each one and compares what it
prints with its `output.txt`; the README and the
[documentation site](../site) embed the code from here, so what they show is
code that runs.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`quickstart`](quickstart) | Two nodes on loopback, a typed process on one, a call and a monitor from the other. The README's example. |
| [`actors`](actors) | An actor built on `grpcproc/actor`: a struct with a method per kind of message, a deferred reply, and how it ends. |
| [`supervisor`](supervisor) | A supervisor restarting an actor that crashed, under the same name, from state kept outside it. |
| [`blockingio`](blockingio) | A line server whose listener and connections are processes: one blocks in `Accept`, the others leave their reads to a goroutine that only sends. |
| [`pubsub`](pubsub) | A topic owned by the process that publishes to it, subscribed to from another node: the events it kept, the ones that follow, and its end. |
| [`testing`](testing) | A two-node scenario as a plain `go test`, with `grpcproctest`: a partition, a crash, a restart. |
| [`singleton`](singleton) | `grpcproc/leader` singletons in a three-node cluster, across the leader crashing: `grpcproc/cron` running a job once a minute on whichever node leads, and a dispenser of numbers that never repeat, which every node calls through `leader.Call`. `go test`s in `testing/synctest` bubbles, whose minutes pass at once. |
| [`guide`](guide) | The tutorial's application: an AI agent runtime wired with `golang.yandex/di`, with a process per conversation, the model on GPU nodes and tools on a sandbox node, run as one program or as a program per node. |

After editing a program, refresh its pinned output and the README's embeds:

```sh
cd examples && go test ./quickstart ./actors ./supervisor ./blockingio ./pubsub -update
go test ./guide -update
cd .. && gofmt -w examples && go run github.com/campoy/embedmd@v1.0.0 -w README.md
```

The site reads the files directly at build time and needs no step of its own.
